Hi, I'm Noel and I've been doing my best to learn frontend web-development by reading and watching free tutorials for a while now. 
I really would like to get remote work doing frontend web development or something related to frontend web development. 

I do my best to look to the bright side of things despite situations and etc., especially since we have a lot of blessings in our lives whether we realize it or not.... such as a roof over our heads and floor beneath our feet, clothes to wear, food to eat, clean water to drink, tast-buds to tast delicious sweets and other scrumptious foods, and so much more to be thankful for. : )
